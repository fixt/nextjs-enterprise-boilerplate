# Next.js boilerplate by Fixt

Starting a new project usually involves wasting loads of hours setting up the same boilerplate. If you're developing with [Next.js](https://github.com/zeit/next.js) we have an awesome base repo for you.



## What's awesome

- Slightly opinionated boilerplate designed for **enterprise applications** with clean code samples.
- Integrated **authentication + authorization** support through [Auth0](https://auth0.com/docs/quickstart/spa/react/01-login).
- **Security hardened** server that automatically finds & fixes vulnerabilities in dependencies through [Helmet](https://helmetjs.github.io/) and [Synk](https://snyk.io/).
- **Extensive component library** through [Semantic UI](https://react.semantic-ui.com/).
- Optionally serves **AMP** validated mobile experiences.
- **Near-instant page loads** and **autocompleting instant search** though [Algolia](https://www.algolia.com/doc/).
- Collect detailed **analytics and metrics** through [Segment](https://github.com/segmentio/analytics-react).

*Developer Experience*

- **Unit Testing** with [Jest](https://jestjs.io/)/[Enzyme](https://airbnb.io/enzyme/) + [Gherkin](https://cucumber.io/docs/gherkin/) for product managers.
- **UI Testing** with [Selenium IDE](https://www.seleniumhq.org/selenium-ide/) + BrowserStack integration.
- **Docker**, **Heroku** ready.
- **ES6 ready** with linting + automatic fixes for JavaScript, JSX, [JS in Markdown](https://github.com/eslint/eslint-plugin-markdown).
- Supports **CSS, Sass or Less** with linting through [Stylelint](https://stylelint.io/).

*Nextjs Customizations*

- **Advanced routing ready** through the modern fork of [next-routes](https://github.com/yolk-hq/next-routes).
- [Dotenv](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv) support **keeps secrets out of the codebase**.
- Webpack extensions wrapped with [next-compose](https://github.com/cyrilwanner/next-compose-plugins) for an easier to use `next.config.js`. Plugins [bundle-analyzer](https://github.com/zeit/next-plugins/tree/master/packages/next-bundle-analyzer) and [next-size](https://github.com/lucleray/next-size) help you **understand build size and composition**.

## NPM/Yarn commands

This boilerplate uses Yarn commands internally. These can easily be swapped out with traditional `npm run`. We feel that Yarn is a little easier to use and faster at most things.
